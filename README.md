# Wheelchair-Trials

This repository contains code for an Android mobile application which is designed to collect data when mounted on the wheel of a wheelchair. This data in turn will help calculate the rolling resistance of the wheelchair.
The objective of this is to enable fast testing of different wheelchair configurations to find which is more efficient.
